## Dependencies
The following non-standard C/C++ library has been used in this project:
- `curses.h`/`ncurses.h` , for acquiring user input without blocking the processing and rendering the UI and graphics


### Compilation
Run `make main` under the ~/src directory of the project (i.e. where this file is located) to compile.

If you ran into issues with `make main`, you can try `make clean` and then try again with `make main`.

### Execution
The executable file, generated once you have run `make main`, is located at `src/main`. Note that config files and logs will be placed at where you called the executable file, not necessarily where the executable file is located.
